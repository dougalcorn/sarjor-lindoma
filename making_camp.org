#+title: Making Camp


A system for campaigns which have a major focus on dangerous wilderness
exploration and where the normal resting rules, Gritty Realism or throwing a
dozen wolves at the party every night don't provide the right balance for feel
and diversity for your campaign.


* Step One: Camp Setup Check
To set up camp, one or more characters in the party must make a *Survival* check
against a DC determined by the hostility of the environment (see the Camp Setup
Table) and count the number of successful rolls out of the number of attempts.
Those characters must all actively contribute in setting the camp, like finding
a suitable location, building a shelter, preparing the campfire, etc.

The Dungeon Master may elect to give some bonuses or advantage to this check,
depending on the situation. For example, instead of making a Camp Setup check
themselves, a character may elect to take the Help action to support another
character making the check. Similarly, a Ranger within his favored terrain may
roll the Camp Setup check with advantage.

** Camp Setup Table
| Survival DC | Camp Environment                                          |
|-------------+-----------------------------------------------------------|
|           0 | Inn or home at a well established settlement              |
|           5 | Peaceful countryside with bountyful resources             |
|          10 | Tamed wilderness, or the streets of an urban setting      |
|          15 | Untamed wilderness of hazardous or unknown terrain        |
|          20 | Deadly wilderness or caves infested by dangerous monsters |
|          25 | Utterly inhospitable wilderness untraveled by most        |
|          30 | Alien planes of unspeakable horror                        |

* Step Two: Camping Score

Add together all the applicable bonus and penalties from the following tables,
taking note if the bonus or penalty applies to the entire party or a single
character, to get the Camping Score for each character.

Adapt or add to those tables as appropriate. For example, the Dungeon Master may
consider that using the *alarm* spell or asking a familiar to stand watch
contribute toward obtaining the *Guards* bonus.

* Step Three: Camping Outcome

Compare the Camping Score for each character to the Camping Outcome table below
to obtain the result of that night's camping.

* Example

** Step One - Camp Setup Check
A party of 4 decides to make camp into a dangerous wilderness they are
exploring. The DC for this Camp Setup check is 20. Two members attempt the Camp
Setup check, with the third member using the Help action to aid one of these
checks. The fourth party member rests (having been reduced to 0 hp). In the end,
only one of checks succeeds (one success out of two attempts).

** Step Two: Camping Score

The camp is in an area known to be patrolled by gnolls, but the party finds an
abandoned cabin before twilight which they successfully camouflage with tree
branches and other natural components. The day was a difficult one, each party
member suffering wounds in battle, one one character suffering from a near death
experience (reduced to 0 hp). They don't lack food and water but still limit
their consumption since they are running low, and take turns to watch for gnoll
patrols but otherwise have an uneventful night.

*** Total for all party members
| Bonus or Penalty | Description                                    |
|------------------+------------------------------------------------|
|               +0 | Half or more succeeded in the Camp Setup check |
|               -3 | Dangerous Location                             |
|               +1 | Permanent Structure                            |
|               +1 | Proper Camp                                    |
|               +1 | Hidden                                         |
|               -1 | On Watch (each takes turn)                     |
|             *-1* | *Party Total*                                  |

** Total for character reduced to 0 hp
| Bonus or Penalty | Description       |
|------------------+-------------------|
|               -1 | Party Total       |
|               -2 | Defeated          |
|             *-3* | *Character Total* |

** Step Three: Camping Outcome

The Party Total for the Camping Score is *-1*, while the total for the
character who was reduced to 0 hp is *-3*. While they have found a suitable
camping location, the night is stressful and all characters only get the benefit
of a *short rest*.
