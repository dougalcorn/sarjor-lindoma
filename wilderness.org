#+title: Wilderness

* Random Wilderness Generation

Using a combination of [[https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/252355/the-solo-adventurer-s-toolbox][The Solo Adventurer's Toolbox]] ([[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::59][Chapter 9: Random
Wilderness Generation]]) and The Welsh Piper [[https://welshpiper.com/hex-based-campaign-design-part-1/][Hex-based Campaign Design]]. Since I'm
publishing these org documents on Github, I should make clear that most of this
file is ripped off completely from The Welsh Piper. Originally, this was just a
notes file I had to get all the information in one place. I had no intention of
expressing ownership of the content.

** Atlas Level Hex Terrain Type
An atlas level hex is 25 miles and has a overarching terrain:
1. Water – lake, sea, or ocean; may be ice-covered in arctic/sub-arctic, or seaweed-choked in tropical/sub-tropical areas
2. Swamp – marsh, bog, fen, or moor; will be partially frozen most or all of the year in arctic/sub-arctic climes
3. Desert – arid land; sandy in tropical/sub-tropical, barrens in temperate, or snowfield in arctic/sub-arctic
4. Plains – grassland, savannah, heath, or scrub; this is farmland in settled hexes, tundra in arctic
5. Forest – woodland; mixed deciduous/evergreen in temperate, conifers in sub-arctic, or jungle in tropical/sub-tropical
6. Hills – rocky ground, rough or broken land (up to 1,000′ above sea level)
7. Mountains – peaks, ridges, and mesas (1,001′ or more above sea level)

TSAT also includes an eighth terrain type of arctic. I chose not to include it
because The Welsh Piper didn't.

Each terrain type has a secondary, tertiary, and wild terrain type that possible to be adjacent.

|           | Water | Swamp | Desert | Plains | Forest | Hills | Mountains |
|-----------+-------+-------+--------+--------+--------+-------+-----------|
| Water     | P     | W     | W      | W      | W      | W     | -         |
| Swamp     | W     | P     | -      | W      | W      | -     | -         |
| Desert    | W     | -     | P      | W      | -      | W     | W         |
| Plains    | S[1]  | S     | T      | P[4]   | S      | T     | -         |
| Forest    | T[2]  | T     | -      | S      | P[5]   | W[8]  | T[11]     |
| Hills     | W     | -     | S[3]   | T      | T[6]   | P[9]  | S         |
| Mountains | W     | -     | W      | -      | W[7]   | S[10] | P[12]     |

1. Treat as coastal (beach or scrub) if adjacent to water
2. 66% light forest
3. 33% rocky desert or high sand dunes
4. Treat as farmland in settled hexes
5. 33% heavy forest
6. 66% forested hills
7. 66% forested mountains
8. 33% forested hills
9. 20% canyon or fissure
10. 40% chance of a pass
11. 33% forested mountains
12. 20% chance of a dominating peak; 10% chance of a mountain pass; 5% volcano

First, determine which adjacent hex tile to reference from (a la Scarlet Heroes,
below). Roll 1d8 counting from the top and going clockwise. Use the tile tolled
as the primary terrain type and then roll 1d12 below to determine the new
terrain type.

| d12 Result | Adjacent Hex Terrain |
|------------+----------------------|
|        1-6 | Primary              |
|        7-9 | Secondary            |
|      10-11 | Tertiary             |
|         12 | Wildcard             |

** Local 5-mil Hex Terrain

*** Overarching Terrain Tables

Within each 25-mile atlas tile, there are 5-mile local tiles. Use TSAT to
determine the minor feature for that overarching terrain type.

Step 1: Roll 1d100 on the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::59][TSAT Overarching Terrain Tables]] to lookup the minor
feature for the local hex:

- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::60][Desert]]

- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::63][Swamp]]

*** Minor Feature Tables

There's a 50/50 chance that the terrain type of the local hex is the same as the overarching altas hex terrain type. Beyond that, each individual overarching terrain types have lookup tables for minor features that could occur in that overarching terrain.

Step 2: Roll either a 1d00 or 1d20 (depending on the table) for the specifics of the minor feature:

- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::63][Clearfelled Area]]
- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::64][Clearing]]

- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::71][Structure]]
- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::73][Swamp]]
- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::73][Unmarked Settlement]]
- [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::74][Waterway]]

Once the minor feature is determined, resolve any open questions, events, or
encounters as needed.

* Travel and Time Tracking

According to 4e PHB, base overland speed is 25 miles/day. That would be 5 hexes
per day. Base overland speed assume relatively clear terrain. Based on the type
of terrain, there is a distance multiplier:

| Multiplier | Terrain                                                                                     |
|------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| x 1/2      | Mostly difficult terrain: dense forests, mountains, deep swamps, rubble-choked ruins        |
| x 3/4      | Extensive difficult terrain: forests, hills, swamps, crumbling ruins, natural caves, cities |
| x 1        | Very little difficult terrain: open fields, plains, roads, clear dungeon corridors          |

Most difficult terrain would reduce to 2 hexes per day. Extensive difficult
terrain would be 3 hexes per day.
