*** Using UNE

I Like this method because it's quick and gives pretty interesting results.

- Determine any pre-conceived facts
- Determine what the NPC is using the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/UNE_The_Universal_NPC_Emulator_(rev).pdf:14][UNE NPC Verb and Noun]] tables. Optionally find the relative power level.
  - Example: [2d100] -> (70 69) = "uneducated" "gunman"
  - Example: [2d100] -> (74 92) = "revolting" "sniper"
- Determine the NPC's Motivation using [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/UNE_The_Universal_NPC_Emulator_(rev).pdf::15][UNE Motivation Verb and Noun]] tables. You may need more than one pair of motivations.
  - Example: [2d100] -> (56 39) = "assist" "military"
  - Example: [2d100] -> (65 41) = "learn" "dreams"

*** Using TSAT

Alteratively, there is a [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf:98][TSAT NPC Generator]]. This method largely lacks flavor.
Adding character elements from Mythic below would provide this color.

- Determine race, gender, alignment and profession. The profession is weighted towards either commoners or tradesperson.
- Determine the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf:100][profession]].
- Determine the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::101][class and level]] if they are an adventurer.
- Finally determine the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/The_Solo_Adventurers_Toolbox_(44655684).pdf::102][disposition and economic status]]



*** Mythic Meaning Tables

Lastly, there is the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf::200][Mythic Meaning Tables]]. These are much more broad and could
be used in conjunction with one of the above methods.

 - Meaning [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf:200][Actions]] and [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf::201][Descriptors]] are typically used for events.

   - Example: [2d100] -> (14 79) = "cautious" "questioning"
   - Example: [2d100] -> (54 24) = "innocent" "defiant"

   - Example: [2d100] -> (68 33) = "loud" "commanding"
   - Example: [2d100] -> (65 52) = "intimidating" "frightened"
 - [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf:206][Character Identity]]
   - Example: [2d100] -> (55 23) = "leader" "driver/pilot"
   - Example: [2d100] -> (46 88) = "innocent" "socialite"
 - [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf:206][Character Motivations]]

   - Example: [2d100] -> (27 62) = "enemy" "multi"
   - Example: [2d100] -> (17 6) = "criminal" "beautiful"


 - [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf::212][Names]] has fragments of names that can be combined in interesting ways
   - Example: [3d100] -> (61 28 15) = "military" "Est" "Color"
   - Example: [3d100] -> (83 85 99) = "Th" "Ti" "Yuh"

Mythic has lots and lots of scene element meaning tables. Here's a clickable
list of all the [[file:~/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/RPGs/MythicGME2eV2.pdf::86][tables at a glance]].
