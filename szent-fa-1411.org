** Village background
Szent Fa, which means "Holy Tree", is a small, tribal village of about 50
people. At the center of the village is a great tree that is the conduit for the
god, Apfa ("Father Tree"). He is a chaotic good spirit whom the village serves.

The village chieftan is Mishka. He's a charismatic leader whom everyone loves.
He's been the chieftan for a while and has no fear for his position. He knows
the village won't follow anyone else. His wife, Olah, is the village shamanka.
She's very serious in serving Apfa. Her communion with Apfa brings all sorts of
chores the village does to satisfy the spirit. She also teaches tribal lore to
the village children and is looking for someone to train to one day take her
place.

Toth is a crafty warrior. He's grown up as the right-hand man to Mishka, but
he's envious of Mishka's position. What's more, Toth and Mishka were rivals of
sorts for Olah when they were young. Olah chose Mishka as her husband without
even thinking much about Toth. Toth knows he'll never be able to take over from
Mishka while he lives. So Toth has decided to figure out a way for Mishka to
die, but not by his hand.

Toth made contact with a roaming band of kobols mercenaries and paid them to
attack the village. His hope would be that Mishka would die in the attack.
Several villagers did die, but not Mishka. Also the tree was severely damaged by
the kobolds.

Olah has determined that in order to heal the tree, she needs the ears of the
kobolds to turn into a fertilizer to pour around the base of the tree. Only by
the fermented blood of Apfa's enemies can the tree heal.

Our wandering heroes know none of this. Rather, they stumble upon the village
the day after the attack while the village is meeting at the base of the tree in
council.
