** Tactics
The goblin hexer uses /lead from the rear/ to turn nearby allies into meat shields while it casts /vexing cloud/ around itself and its closest allies and enemies. It then targets an enemy defender with /stinging hex/ and uses its /blinding hex/ on foes making ranged attacks. When another goblin within 10 squares uses /goblin tactics/, the goblin hexer uses /incite bravery/ to allow that goblin to make a free attack.
