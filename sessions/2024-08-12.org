* Session 4 - <2024-08-12 Mon 18:45>

When last we left our pair, they had just survived a deadly encounter with a
Bugbear. They then left the Goblin lair to find a safe campsire in the wild.
There's still one more room left to explore: the Wizard's Chamber. They had
found a magic door made of pure flame as well as a runestone that looks as if it
would disable the trap.

Goblin Lair: this lair is made up of 6 rooms. As of yet, only 3 have been explored.
